Skills
------
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS
- Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, CircleCI, Flask, Vagrant, Git, AWS


Projects
--------
##### Implement a CI/CD Pipeline to Roll Out Containerized Microservices Using Rolling Deployment
- Created a CI/CD pipeline to automate a rolling deployment strategy for a containerized web application using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, NGINX, and Amazon EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service).
- Implemented continuous integration to lint web application, containerize it, scan image for vulnerabilities, and store it on an image registry after validation.
- Set up continuous deployment to deploy/update a Kubernetes cluster running the Docker container.


##### Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API
- Containerized a machine learning microservice API with Docker, that predicts housing prices in Boston using a pre-trained scikit-learn model.
- Set up continuous integration using CircleCI to automate the process of building the testing environment, installing software dependencies, and building/validating the Docker image.
- Deployed the Docker container to a local cluster using Kubernetes.


##### Deploy a High-Availability Web App using CloudFormation
- Created and deployed the infrastructure necessary to run a high-availability web application using AWS CloudFormation, distributed across multiple availability zones to increase fault tolerance.
- Increased application availability and decreased unused capacity by automating the process of launching/terminating instances to better match resources needed to handle the current traffic demand and save on infrastructure expenses.
- Converted business requirements into cloud architecture diagram using Lucidchart as part of requirements analysis.


##### Jenkins Pipelines on AWS
- Installed and configured a Jenkins server on an AWS instance—authenticated for continuous deployment to an AWS S3 bucket configured to host a static website.
- Created a CI/CD pipeline to perform code linting and automated deployment of a static site—triggered when code changes are pushed to a GitHub repository.


##### [Configure a Linux Server to Host a Web Application](http://itemcatalog.com.35.168.251.43.xip.io/)
- Set up web application server—built from a baseline Linux installation—secured against a number of attack vectors and configured to serve the Coordinate App project.
- Automated process to check for, update, and install security packages each day to prevent system from being exploited through known software vulnerabilities
- Implemented using Apache, Ubuntu, PostgreSQL, and Amazon Lightsail.


##### [Build a RESTful Web Application](http://itemcatalog.com.35.168.251.43.xip.io/)
- Designed and built a responsive, RESTful web application with persistent storage for users to view upcoming events using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Implemented user authentication and authorization to protect against CSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks, to verify event ownership before updating/deleting events, and to enable users to mark events as attending/considering.
- Achieved performance score of 100 using Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools.


##### [Single-Page Map Application with Asynchronous API Requests](https://davidsimowitz.dev/neighborhood-map/index.html)
- Built single-page, responsive map application that allows users to view a list of neighborhood establishments.
- Implemented list filter to update map markers—from Google Maps API—and list locations with respect to search input immediately on each keystroke or other text entry mechanism.
- Displayed venue data sourced from Foursquare API upon user selection of map marker or list location.
- Programmed using JavaScript, Knockout, HTML, and CSS.



Experience
